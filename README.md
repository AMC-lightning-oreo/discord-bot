So yeah, some guys asked for it, some I made a repo for those who wanted a basic template they could learn from cuz why not! So i added 2 levels of really basic templates you can add on from however you like! As always, if you like my content, consider upvoting and adding my discord bot! Details of which are on my website! Any trouble you get into becuz of my code will not be my fault and will be for you to deal with! Also, this is a open source platform and by using my code, it means you agree to abide by the terms i may ask for! One of which is about HOW I WILL NOT BE IN TROUBLE IF YOU SOMEHOW, USED MY CODE AND LAND YOURSELF INTO TROUBLE! THAT I CANNOT HELP YOU WITH! Do comment if you want me to come up with level3 and more or if you want to suggest more content I should add to on my github page! Anyways Have a good day!
